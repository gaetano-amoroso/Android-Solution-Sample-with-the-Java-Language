        “Cry for a Shadow”  is an instrumental rock piece recorded by the Beatles on 22 June 1961.
            It was written by George Harrison with John Lennon, as a parody of the Shadows style.
            (The Shadows, who backed Cliff Richard, were the biggest British instrumental rock &amp;
            roll group at the time of the recording.)  It imitates the lead guitar with typical
            Hank Marvin licks, the melodic bass fills, and even has an imitation during the second
            middle eight of the famous Jet Harris yell.  It is the only Beatles track to be credited
            to Lennon and Harrison alone.  “Cry for a Shadow”\’s original title was “Beatle Bop”.
            “Cry for a Shadow” is one of only two officially released Beatles singles to feature
            Pete Best on drums.  The other is “Ain\’t She Sweet”, although it\’s alleged that studio
            drummer Bernard Purdie “sweetened” the drum parts on this recording for American release.
